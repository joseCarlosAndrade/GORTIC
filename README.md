# GORTIC (to be changed)

My Gartic implementation in Golang

## Dependencies

So far, the only dependency needed is [raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) for the inteface development.

Check the `Makefile` for further instructions on how to execute the application server, interface, and drawing mode.
